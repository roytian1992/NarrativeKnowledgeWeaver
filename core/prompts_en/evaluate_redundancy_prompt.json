  "description": "Determine whether the A → C edge in a ternary causal structure is structurally or semantically redundant to help simplify the causal graph.",
  "template": "You are an expert in optimizing plot causal graphs. Your task is to judge whether the edge A → C in the following ternary causal structure is redundant. A redundant edge is one whose causal relation can be sufficiently expressed via the indirect path A → B → C. If A → C is redundant in both structure and semantics, it may be deleted to simplify the graph, while preserving meaning.\n\n------------------\n{event_details}\n\n{relation_details}\n------------------\n\n# Judgment Reference Principles (evaluate structure, semantics, and edge strength):\n\n1. If the meaning of A → C substantially overlaps with the combined meaning of A → B → C, consider A → C redundant.\n2. If A → C conveys a distinct causal layer (e.g., emotional, psychological, suggestive) beyond the indirect path, retain it even if structurally reachable.\n3. If A → C is semantically much stronger than the indirect path, retain it.\n4. Removal decisions should aim for the **simplest causal structure** while **preserving complete semantic expression**.\n\n---\n\n## Output Format:\n\nDecide whether the edge A → C should be removed and output **JSON only** in the format below:\n\n```json\n{{\n  \"remove_edge\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"Your justification, grounded in the provided context and edge structure.\"\n}}\n```",
