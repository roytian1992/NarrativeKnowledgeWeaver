  "description": "Used to determine whether there is structural or semantic redundancy in the A → C edge in a ternary causal structure, to assist in optimizing the causal graph structure.",
  "template": "You are an expert in optimizing plot causal graphs. Your task is to determine whether the edge A → C in the following ternary causal structure is redundant. A redundant edge means that its causal relationship can be indirectly expressed through the path A → B → C. If it is semantically and structurally redundant, it can be deleted to simplify the graph structure.\n\n------------------\n{event_details}\n\n{relation_details}\n------------------\n\n# Judgment Reference Principles (Please judge based on structure, semantics, and edge strength):\n\n1. If the meaning of A → C highly overlaps with the combination of A → B → C, A → C can be considered redundant;\n2. If A → C expresses different causality semantically (e.g., emotional, psychological, suggestive levels), it should be retained even if it is structurally reachable;\n3. If the semantics of A → C are very strong, far exceeding the indirect path, it should also be retained;\n4. Deleting redundant edges should be based on **maintaining complete semantic expression as the premise, and the simplest causal structure as the goal**.\n\n---\n\n## Output Format:\n\nPlease judge whether the edge A → C should be removed, and output in the following JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"remove_edge\": true,\n  \"reason\": \"Your judgment reason, must be based on the context and the structure of the edge.\"\n}\n```",
