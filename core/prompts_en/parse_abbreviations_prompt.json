  "template": "Read the insight text and generate a JSON according to the requirements.\n\n[Task Scope]\n- Simultaneously extract:\n  1) English abbreviations/codes/models: Consisting of Latin letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, and slashes, length 2–20, preserving case and symbols;\n  2) Technical terms: Engineering, technology, military, aerospace, computing/AI, organizations and systems, plans/projects, and other related terms, which can be multi-word phrases.\n\n[Fields and Constraints (Whitelist)]\n- Each entry must include:\n  - name: Fragment [strictly consistent with the original text]; preserving original characters such as case, spaces, hyphens, dots, and slashes;\n  - description: Objective explanation (Chinese) of 12–30 characters;\n- Optional fields:\n  - abbr: If it is an abbreviation/code/model, fill in the abbreviation from the original text (usually the same as name);\n  - full: Fill in only when the full name is [explicitly given] in the text (consistent with the original text);\n  - zh: Chinese name/translation (can be omitted if name is already in Chinese);\n- Strictly forbidden to output fields other than name/description/abbr/full/zh.\n\n[Prohibition of Splitting and Merging]\n- Do not combine multiple entries: When encountering multiple abbreviations/models/codes connected by \"/,,,,, and\" (e.g., \"550W/550A\", \"X-15B/C\", \"AB-1 and AB-2\"), they must be [individually split] into multiple independent entries.\n- Never generate entries where the name contains merging symbols (e.g., \"/\", \"and\", \"with\") and refers to two or more objects.\n\n[Name Consistency Rules]\n- The name must be a [complete, continuous] fragment appearing in the original text, with character-by-character consistency (including case, spaces, hyphens, dots, slashes, etc.). Do not rewrite, correct, or normalize the name.\n\n[Handling Co-occurrence of Abbreviations and Full Names]\n- When \"Full Name (Abbreviation)\" or \"Abbreviation (Full Name)\" appears: The abbreviation is the main entry; only when the full name is used independently and has terminological value, then extract the full name as a separate entry.\n- Do not use the entire \"Full Name (Abbreviation)\" segment as the name.\n\n[Normalization Scope]\n- Description and zh can be interpretively normalized, but the name must not be modified.\n- abbr is filled only when it is indeed an abbreviation/model/code; full is filled only when the full name explicitly appears in the original text.\n\n[Filtering and Boundaries]\n- Exclude: Abbreviations related to film/stage/audio production (e.g., O.S./OS, V.O./VO, etc.); only \"value + unit\" (e.g., 10km, 3dB, 9G); generic words without specific reference (e.g., technology, system only generally refer); proper nouns (non-organizations).\n- **New: Exclude overly generic or broad Chinese nouns** (e.g., \"transport boat\", \"navigator\", \"digital life\", \"detector\", \"spaceship\", \"satellite\", \"robot\"), unless the text assigns a specific name or number (e.g., \"Transport Boat No. 33\", \"Navigator Space Station\", \"Digital Life Project\").\n- The total number of new additions should not exceed 15.\n\n[Deduplication]\n- Deduplicate by [exact name match (case and punctuation sensitive)]; retain the more complete version.\n- Correct: Original text \"550W/550A\" → 550W and 550A \n- Incorrect: {{\"name\":\"550W/550A\", ...}} (Forbidden)\n\n[Current Background Information]\n{current_background}\n\n[Output Format]\n",
