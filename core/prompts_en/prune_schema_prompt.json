  "description": "Based on the usage distribution and definition descriptions of entities/relations, output a list of entity or relation types that should be deleted. Only output necessary removals, without proposing merging/renaming/adding solutions.",
  "template": "Read the following distributions and definitions, and determine whether there are entity or relation types that **must be deleted**. Only make deletion suggestions when evidence is sufficient; if the case is ambiguous or optional, do not include it.\n\n【Deletion Criteria (any one is sufficient; apply conservatively)】\n- **Zero usage**: count=0 or document coverage=0.\n- **Near-zero and non-critical**: overall proportion extremely low and only appearing in very few documents, and semantics can be stably covered by a more general/clear type.\n- **Systematic mismatch**: heavily used but domain/range or direction inconsistent with definition, and such usage is already properly covered by other types; keeping it will only cause confusion.\n- **Redundant synonym**: semantically equivalent or highly overlapping with another frequent and clearly defined type, and historical usage can be losslessly mapped to that type.\n- **Non-operational**: definition too vague or self-contradictory, making it impossible to label/extract stably over time.\n\n【Output Requirements】\n- Output only one JSON: {{\"feedbacks\": [ ... ]}}\n- Each item is **one natural language sentence**: write “Delete + type name + brief reason (include key numbers such as count, coverage, overlap target)”. Use <entity> or <relation> as a prefix to indicate whether the suggestion is for an entity or a relation.\n- Only list the names of relation types or entity types; do not write group names; do not provide alternatives.\n- If there are no types that must be deleted, return an empty list: {{\"feedbacks\": []}}\n\n【Entity Type Distribution】\n{entity_type_distribution}\n\n【Relation Type Distribution】\n{relation_type_distribution}\n\n【Entity Type Descriptions】\n{entity_type_description_text}\n\n【Relation Type Descriptions】\n{relation_type_description_text}\n\n【Output Format (JSON only)】\n```json\n{{\n  \"feedbacks\": [\n    \"Delete relation_type 'supports', semantics already stably covered by 'allies_with'.\",\n    \"Delete entity_type 'Artifact', definition overlaps with 'Object' and usage is replaceable.\"\n  ]\n}}\n```",
