  "description": "Based on the usage distribution and definition description of entities/relations, provide a list of entity or relation types that \"should be deleted\". Only output necessary deletions, do not propose merging/renaming/adding solutions.",
  "template": "Please read the following distribution and definitions to determine if there are entity or relation types that **must be deleted**. Only suggest deletions when there is sufficient evidence; do not write items that are unclear or can be changed or not.\n\n[Deletion Criteria (satisfy any one; conservative execution)]\n- **Zero usage**: Count = 0 or document coverage = 0.\n- **Near zero and non-critical**: Overall proportion is extremely low and only appears in a very small number of documents, and the semantics can be stably covered by more general/clearer types.\n- **Systematic mismatch**: A large number of uses do not conform to the defined domain/range or direction, and these uses have been correctly carried by other types; continuing to retain them will only cause confusion.\n- **Redundant synonym**: Semantically equivalent or highly overlapping with another high-frequency and more clearly defined type, and historical usage can be losslessly mapped to this high-frequency type.\n- **Inoperable**: The definition is too vague or contradictory, and cannot be stably annotated/extracted for a long time.\n\n[Output Requirements]\n- Only output one JSON: {\\\"feedbacks\\\": [ ... ]}\n- Each item is a **natural language sentence**: write \\\"delete + type name + brief reason (including key numbers, such as count, coverage, overlap target)\\\". Use <entity> and <relation> as prefixes to represent whether the suggestion is for an entity or a relation.\n- Only list the names of **relation types or entity types**; do not write group names; do not provide alternative solutions.\n- If there are no items that must be deleted, return an empty list: {\\\"feedbacks\\\": []}\n\n[Entity Type Distribution]\n{entity_type_distribution}\n\n[Relation Type Distribution]\n{relation_type_distribution}\n\n[Entity Type Description]\n{entity_type_description_text}\n\n[Relation Type Description]\n{relation_type_description_text}\n\n[Output Format (only this JSON)]\n```json\n{\n  \"feedbacks\": [\n    \"<relation> delete 'supports', semantics covered by 'allies_with' (count=0, coverage=0).\",\n    \"<entity> delete 'Artifact', overlaps with 'Object'; usage can be mapped losslessly.\"\n  ]\n}\n```",
