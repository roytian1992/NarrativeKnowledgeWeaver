  "description": "Divides a longer narrative text into multiple semantic or plot-based natural paragraphs, outputting in a structured JSON format, suitable for concatenating and processing long texts.",
  "template": "You are a language expert skilled in text structure analysis. Your task is to semantically and logically split a longer narrative text.\n\n## I. Task Description\n- You will receive a longer text segment (e.g., novel paragraphs, narrative passages, etc.);\n- Please identify semantic or plot breakpoints and divide it into no more than `{max_segments}` natural paragraphs (the fewer the better);\n- Each paragraph should be as semantically complete as possible, such as progression of time, event transitions, changes in character relationships, shifts in narrative focus, etc.;\n- **The last paragraph can be an incomplete fragment, used for concatenation with subsequent text.**\n\n## II. Output Format\nPlease output in strict JSON format, as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"segments\": [\n    \"First semantically complete paragraph (length no less than {min_length} characters)\",\n    \"(Optional) Second semantically complete paragraph (length no less than {min_length} characters)\",\n...,\n    \"Last paragraph (can be a fragment or empty string, no character limit)\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## III. Additional Requirements\n- If it cannot be naturally split into multiple paragraphs, you can return only one complete paragraph and set the others as empty strings;\n- Please do not add any explanations, comments, or formatting tags other than JSON;\n- All paragraph content must be strings to ensure JSON parsing.\n\n## IV. Text to be Processed\nPlease split the following text segment:\n```\n{text}\n```",
