  "description": "Strict Chain-of-Thought (CoT) judgment under the minimalist edge types of CAUSES / INDIRECT_CAUSES / PART_OF / NONE; reasoning is for internal use only, final output is JSON only.",
  "template": "You are an event graph modeling expert. Please perform rigorous step-by-step reasoning, but keep all reasoning internal, and ultimately output only standard JSON (do not expose the reasoning process).\n\n[Task Goal]\n- Make a unique judgment among the following relations: CAUSES, INDIRECT_CAUSES, PART_OF, or NONE (insufficient evidence/irrelevant).\n- Separately provide the temporal order (E1_before_E2 / E2_before_E1 / Overlap_or_Simultaneous / Unknown).\n\n[Input]\n[Event One]\n{event_1_info}\n\n[Event Two]\n{event_2_info}\n\n[Chain of Thought Draft]\nStep 0 | Information Alignment: Summarize the names, temporal clues, locations, participants, and key sentences of the two events; if time is missing, mark as unknown.\nStep 1 | Initial Temporal Judgment: Based on clear timestamps, relative words (before/after/subsequently/during/simultaneously), and narrative order, obtain one of the four states; if evidence conflicts, mark as Unknown.\nStep 2 | Subordination/Phase Judgment (Priority Gate): If E1 is a step/segment/phase of E2, or temporal envelopment shows E1 is highly covered by E2, or strong phase markers such as \"during/step/phase/segment/process/implementation/preparation/conclusion\" appear, then decision = PART_OF, stop subsequent causal judgment.\nStep 3 | Indirect Causality Judgment: If the connection between E1 and E2 must rely on an independent intermediary/condition to be established (if the intermediary is removed, it is not established), or E1 only provides permission/resources rather than direct triggering, then tend towards INDIRECT_CAUSES; if there are strong direct triggering clues at the same time, proceed to Step 4 for comparison of strength.\nStep 4 | Direct Causality Judgment: If triggering/inhibiting words such as \"leads to/triggers/causes/thus/resulting in/prevents/avoids\" appear, and the time is sequential, and it does not rely on a key intermediary, then decision = CAUSES.\nStep 5 | Non-Causal Alternative Reason Exclusion: If it is more like a common upstream, parallel/related, contrast/transition, or only explanatory/recapitulatory information, then judge as NONE.\nStep 6 | Conflict Resolution and Uniqueness: If multiple paths are simultaneously valid, arbitrate by priority: PART_OF > INDIRECT_CAUSES > CAUSES > NONE. If evidence is weak and uncertain, choose NONE.\nStep 7 | Confidence Calibration: Score positively based on evidence strength (trigger words, temporal clarity, semantic consistency); score negatively based on conflict/missing/ambiguity, to get a confidence in the 0-1 range.\nStep 8 | Output Preparation: Write a reason of 20-40 characters (only provide conclusive evidence, do not expose reasoning details). Then stop thinking and only output JSON.\n\n[Output Format (Strictly Follow)]\n{{\n  \"relation\": \"CAUSES | INDIRECT_CAUSES | PART_OF | NONE\",\n  \"temporal_order\": \"E1_before_E2 | E2_before_E1 | Overlap_or_Simultaneous | Unknown\",\n  \"reason\": \"20-40 character conclusive evidence, no external reasoning details\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.0\n}}\n\nOnly output the above JSON, no extra text.",
